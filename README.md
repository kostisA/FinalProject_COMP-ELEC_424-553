# Final Project COMP/ELEC 424/553

TODO: 
- ssh wirelessly into AI-64
- Vision: run script - might need to modify camera dims & add camera index (instructions canvas)
- Move Car: add PWM code to reset_car, start_car, turn_car - might need to change pin values
- Turn Car: tune PD variables (P: responsiveness to error, D: reduce oscillation around desired trajectory)

- Driver: device tree addition, write driver to read encoder & write file, manage speed in main loop using driver & speed encoder by reading file

- Stop Sign: insert logic to main loop https://github.com/fredotran/traffic-sign-detector-yolov4/blob/main/yolov4-traffic_road_signs-detection-images.ipynb

- Write hackster page
